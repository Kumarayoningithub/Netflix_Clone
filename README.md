(Netflix Landing Page Clone)
This project is a partial clone of the Netflix landing page, designed as part of a web development practice. The project replicates the main interface of Netflix's homepage, including a navigation bar, hero section with a call-to-action button, and background image.

Features:

Responsive Design: The page adjusts to different screen sizes.
Hero Section: Includes a promotional message, an email input field, and a "Get Started" button.
Custom Styling: Utilizes CSS for styling, with external fonts and a background image.

Technologies Used:

HTML5: For structuring the content.
CSS3: For the styling and layout.
